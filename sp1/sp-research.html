			<h2> RESEARCH </h2>
			<img src="images/forskningsmall.jpg"/ id="imgresearch">
			<p id="p1"> Our museum offers various ways to use our resources and contribute to them. <br/>
				We have online records, laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of universities 
				around the country.
			</p>
			<h3> Biology and Medicine </h3>
			<p> From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique 
				insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
			</p>
			<p> For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, 
				thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the 
				history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
				and the first heart transplant. 
			</p>
			<p> Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing 
				animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
			</p>
			<h3> Robotics and AI </h3>
			<p> The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.
				 From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say 
				 hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
			</p>
			<h3> Ecology </h3>
			<p> As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it 
				becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
